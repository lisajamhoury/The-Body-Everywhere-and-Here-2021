## Course Description

Today’s internet, made up of mostly text documents and two-dimensional images and videos, is the result of historical limitations in bandwidth, graphics processing and input devices. These limitations have made the internet a place where the mind goes, but the body cannot follow. Recent advances in motion capture devices, graphics processing, machine learning, bandwidth and browsers, however, are paving the way for the body to find its place online. This course will explore embodied interactions in the browser and across networks. Specifically we’ll explore TensorFlow.js models like PoseNet and Hand Pose, and Microsoft Kinect in p5.js and Three.js. Assignments will consider designing engaging embodied experiences for individual and social interactions online. Experience with Node, HTML and JavaScript is helpful but not required. ICM level programming experience is required.

## Evaluation and Policies

See [Evaluation and Policies](/policies.md).

## Guidelines

A big part of learning at ITP is learning from each other. So share your work and in exchange you'll get to see everyone else's!

1. Do the assignments.
2. Contribute to discussions.
3. Post documentation: Ideally something visual, some written thoughts, and code. If you are struggling with your sketch and can't get things to work, put your energy into writing about what didn't work and what you did to try to solve it.

## Attendance

Please be on time! I commit to ending class on time, which means I will start class on time so we can get through all class material.

According to the [ITP/IMA Class Attendance policy](http://facultyhelp.itp.nyu.edu/academic-policies/itp-ima-class-attendance-policy), for 7-week, and 6-week, half-term courses, up to one unexcused absence is permitted. Exceeding these unexcused absence guidelines is grounds for automatic failure. I really don't want to fail you, so please please please communicate with me about your schedule and needs.

Please review the attendance and participation requirements under [Evaluation and Policies](/policies.md).

## Code of Conduct

Over these seven weeks we are going on an exciting and difficult journey together. In order to learn and innovate, it's important for all of us to create an atmosphere that celebrates our vulnerability and diversity. Please review the ITP/IMA [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ITPNYU/ITP-IMA-Code-of-Conduct) and [Rules of Play](https://github.com/ITPNYU/ITP-IMA-Code-of-Conduct/blob/main/rules-of-play.md).

If you are uncomfortable with any of the class proceedings, you are always welcome to reach out to me (lisa.jamhoury@nyu.edu), our area head Mimi Yin (mimi.yin@nyu.edu), the [Bias Response Line](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/equal-opportunity/bias-response/report-a-bias-incident.html), or [Title IX](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/equal-opportunity/title9/reporting-and-resources/reporting-options.html).

Look out for the [office hours and help sessions that the residents offer](https://itp.nyu.edu/residents/contact-the-residents/). You can find my office hours [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUlFdHBUdGtNZlpEfGRlZmF1bHR8NGM3YjcyZWMxYWNkZDc1M2YxMTE5MjFjNWU5ODVkMjY) and my email is lisa.jamhoury@nyu.edu. Don't hesitate to reach out!

## Homework Assignments

Assignments are due **before** class each week. I will not give credit for assignments that are turned in late. Keeping in mind that I want you to succeed, and that the material can sometimes be challenging, **I absolutely prefer tentative work with good documentation to work that is turned in late**.

[Use this form to turn in your homework assignments](https://forms.gle/w6D7AfcFkZhn2NUW9).

[Here's the spreadsheet with everyone's responses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vJynGu0UdHP__KTuiy1dD4giP1ig-fKKR_iOQnQpdzg/edit?usp=sharing).

## Homework Roulette

Each week an unbiased algorithm will choose 4 students to present their homework to class. The students presenting will be listed on the board at the start of class so they can take a few minutes to prepare before class starts. This is an _informal_ five-minute presentation of documentation, code, questions and class feedback. There are 16 students in class, so we'll have 4 present in classes 2-5.

If you know you will be traveling at any time in the semester, please let me know as soon as you can so you can present in an earlier class.

## Final Assignment

The final two weeks of class will be devoted to final projects. Use this assignment to delve more deeply into the subject matter in one piece of work. You are welcome to work in pairs or groups. 

This will comprise 20% of your grade. You will not be graded on whether it works on not, you will be graded on your process and documentation. So, please make sure that you leave time to document your project well!
